# seven-eat-nine

This 2015 HTML/JavaScript game (src/; JavaScript entry point is src/Scripts/Loop.js fu_Initialize) is a text Robotron-like presented with only minor updates as written from scratch (including comments, or lack thereof) over the course of 48 hours for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 33 competition.

Its Ludum Dare page has been lost to time, but the game can be played [here](http://www.thatwhichismedia.com/games/seveneatnine/ld33cleanup/index.html).

This game was written from scratch, but borrowed concepts from at-the-time work-in-progress [Time To Die: Adventures](https://thatwhichis.itch.io/time-to-die-adventures) (2016).

Time To Die: Adventure's renderer was rewritten for use in the Nintendo Web Framework (NWF), demonstrated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyQLzl1rQ8g).
